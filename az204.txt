    - The data which is collected can be Metric or Log
        - Metric: the numeric data which is collected is called metric.
            - CPU utilization
            - Memory utilization
            - Disk utilization
            - No of request in queue
            - No of Read/Write operations
            - Represent them in the format of Graph/Chart.
        - Log: A unstructured text data in JSON/XML format
            - Event Log
            - Activity Log

    - Application Insights
        - Is a monitoring tool for web, storage, functions etc.
        - You can enable AI while creating the service or after creation.
        - App Insights collects the telemetry from the web apps, functions, storage accounts etc.
        - It can visualize it in the form of graph and chart.
        - It can collect the performance couter data from the application running on Azure or om-premise or other cloud.
        - Application uses and Instrumentation key to connect the AI.
        - Live metrics to view the live telemetry of the app such as incoming requests, outgoing responses and server errors
        - Application Map is used to view and diagnose the dependencies of the app such as storage, sql db, cosmosdb, event hub etc.
        - Availability test : Url ping test allow us to test the Availability of the app from various regions.
        
Communication methods for apps
    - Http Based
        - Request-Response pattern
        - Sender and receiver must be online
        - By default synchronous 
        - Response is mandatory for every request
        - One-to-one communication
        - Real-time communication
    - Message Based
        - Uses a publish-subscribe pattern
        - One app send message to a queue and second app receive it later
        - Sender and receiver may not be online at same time.
        - Not real-time communication.
        - One-to-many communication supported.
        - Asynchronous by default.
    - Event based
        - Publish-subscribe (Observer pattern) 
        - One-to-may communication
        - Real-time communication
        - No response required
        - Asynchronous by default.

Message Driven Applications
    - Azure Service Bus
        - AMQP protocol based. (Advanced Message Queueing protocol).
        - One messsage size upto 256Kb
        - Max TTL is 14 Days
        - Ensure FIFO ordering
        - Encrypt the message in binary
        - Duplicate detection support
        - Dead-letter queue support
        - Used in enterprise Applications
        - Complex to implement comapred to Storage queue.        
    - Azure Storage Account Queue
        - Http based queueing system 
        - All operations of queue is performed using Http APis (Enqueue, Dequeue, Clearqueue, Peekqueue)
        - One message max capacity is 64Kb
        - One message max TTL (Time to Live) is 7 days.
        - Store the message as plain text (no message encryption)
        - No FIFO guarantee
        - No Duplicate detection 
        - No Dead-letter queue.
        - Simple to implement 
        - Used for simple app message systems
    - Service Bus Service Types
        - Queues
            - Message is added to a queue which can be consumed by any subscriber.
            - Only one subscriber is able to receive the message.
        - Topics
            - Deliver same message to one or more subscribed who had subscribed for the interested type of messages.
            - Deliver message to more than one subscribers
            - In topic we can create subscription filters
                - $Default filter - This is by default exist in topic. This deliver all messages. Remove default filter and add custom filters
                - Custom filters:
                    - Boolean Filter : Set a boolean condition
                    - SQL Filter : Set an SQL query condition (a subtype of Boolean filter)
                    - Correlation filter: Correlation ID is used to deliver messages.
            
Event Based services
    - Event Grid
        - Fully managed Azure Service.User need not to create event grid. 
        - Event Grid is already integrated with many Azure services such as Storage Account, Resource Group, Subscriptions, App Service, CosmosDB etc.
        - When ever some event (action) occurs in the service it sends a Notification event to the event grid and the event grid forwards that event data to associated subscribers.
        - Publishers: Storage Account, Resource Group, Subscriptions, App Service, CosmosDB, Custom events using Custom Topic
        - Subscribers: Azure Function, Logic App, Event Hub, Service Bus Queue, Custom App
    - Event Hub
        - Handles millions of events data at same time.
        - Support upto 32 partitions
        - Multiple subscribers can process the data in real-time (Function, PowerBi)
        - If you want to store event data for future processing then use capture method (store events data to storage account).
        - it support Apache Kafka protocol, so you can use Event hub as a Kafka cluster.
    - Notification Hub (Mobile Apps)
        - Mobile Apps notifications.
        - Used to send platform specific notifications.
        - Used for sending push notifications.
        - Offline messaging.
